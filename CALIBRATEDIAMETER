(CALIBRATEDIAMETER)
(Description: Calibrate the Diameter of the probe using a ring guage)
(Initial coding 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Your probe must be concentric and you must use a ring guage!!!!!!!!!!)
(#1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets and center probe)
(#2 is the expected DIAMETER)

(important local variables)
#130 = @101             (TOOL DIAMETER PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)
#100 = @100             (TOOL NUMBER PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)

(calling our slot macros the first time centers probe)
G65 "PROBEXSLOT" A#1 B#2 C0 
G65 "PROBEYSLOT" A#1 B#2 C0 


(calling our slot macros a second time gives an accurate inspection)
G65 "PROBEXSLOT" A#1 B#2 C0 
G65 "PROBEYSLOT" A#1 B#2 C0

(average Diameter calculation)
(@999 and @998 are set in the slot macros)
(this could be improved by keeping track of both X and Y diameters and controling probe orientation)
#131 = @998          (measured ring guage diameter in x)
#132 = @999          (measured ring guage diameter in y)
#133 = #131-#2       (diameter error in x)
#134 = #131-#2       (diameter error in y)
#135 = [#133+#134]/2 (average error)
#136 = #135 +#130    (diameter update)
