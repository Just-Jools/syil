(PROBEBORE)
(Description: Probe a bore in X and Y)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe inspection report)
(#1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in)
(#2 is the expected length)
(#3 is the expected width)
(#17 turns on inspection report on/off: 0 leaves it off (default); 1 turns it on )

(important local variables)
#130 = @101             (TOOL DIAMETER PROVIDED BY PROBECONFIG MACRO)

(calling our slot macros the first time centers probe)
G65 "PROBEXSLOT" A#1 B#2 Q0 
G65 "PROBEYSLOT" A#1 B#3 Q0 

(simple inspection reporting)
IF[#17>0]

(average Diameter calculation)
(@999 and @998 are set in the web macros)
#131 = @998
#132 = @999

 MENU_ADD["Part Length In X: @998",""]; 
 MENU_ADD["Part Width In Y: @999",""]; 
 MENU["INSPECTION REPORT","RESULTS","",1];
