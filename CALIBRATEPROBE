(CALIBRATE PROBE TIP DIAMETER)

(#1 is the expected X length of the part)
(#2 is the probe tool number)


G90 G94 G17 G49 G40 G80
G20                              (inch)


#110 = 100 (FEED SPEED)
#111 = 50 (FAST PROBE SPEED)
#112 = 25 (SLOW PROBE SPEED)

(probe x starting from a negative offset and probing in the positive direction)

(Assume you are starting on the left X side, 0.5 inch away, of the part at the probe z height)
