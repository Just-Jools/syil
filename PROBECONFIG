#100 = R_SYS_INFO[0,2]  (SAVE CURRENT TOOL NUMBER TO #100 --- assume its the probe)
#110 = 100              (FEED SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 2540mm))
#111 = 50               (FAST PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 1270mm)
#112 = 2.5              (SLOW PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 63mm)
#120 = .25              (WEB BACKOFF DISTANCE in, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 6mm)
