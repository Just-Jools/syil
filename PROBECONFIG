@100 = R_SYS_INFO[0,2]           (TOOL NUMBER, GRABS THE CURRENT TOOL AND ASSUMES IT'S THE PROBE. CAN BE CHANGED TO A SPECIFIC VALUE EX: 99)
@101 = R_TOOL_DATA[0,@100,3]     (TOOL DIAMETER, DO NOT TOUCH!!!)
@102 = @101/2                    (TOOL RADIUS, DO NOT TOUCH!!!)
@103 = 50                        (FEED SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 2540mm))
@104 = 50                        (FAST PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 1270mm)
@105 = 2.5                       (SLOW PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 63mm)
@106 = .5                        (WEB PROBE DISTANCE in, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 6mm)
@107 = [R_TOOL_DATA[0,@100,203]] (TOOL LENGHT OFFSET, DO NOT TOUCH!!!)
@108 = .125                      (PROBE BACKOFF DISTANCE,change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 3mm)
