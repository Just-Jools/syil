(macro to setup probe specs and units, called by every macro)

(important local variables)
@100 = R_SYS_INFO[0,2]           (SAVE CURRENT TOOL NUMBER TO #100 --- assume its the probe)
@101 = R_TOOL_DATA[0,@1,3]       (READ THE PROBE TOOL DIAMETER)
@102 = 100                       (FEED SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 2540mm))
@103 = 50                        (FAST PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 1270mm)
@104 = 2.5                       (SLOW PROBE SPEED in/m, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 63mm)
@105 = .25                       (WEB BACKOFF DISTANCE in, change to match your unit of choice, for metric users start at 6mm)
