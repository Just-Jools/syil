(PROBECIRCULARBOSS)
(Description: Probe a circular boss in X and Y)
(Initial Coding: Justin Gray)
(Modified 1/14/2024: Joshua Smith)
(Simplified WCS extended number math, added probe error checking, added probe inspection report)
(#1 is the work coordinate system to store offsets in)
(#2 is the expected DIAMETER)
(#3 is the Z drop height)
(#17 turns on inspection report on/off: 0 leaves it off (default); 1 turns it on )

(calling our web macros the first time centers us)
G65 "PROBEXWEB" A#1 B#2 C#3 Q0
G65 "PROBEYWEB" A#1 B#2 C#3 Q0

(calling our web macros the second time gives an accurate center)
G65 "PROBEXWEB" A#1 B#2 C#3 Q0
G65 "PROBEYWEB" A#1 B#2 C#3 Q0

(simple inspection reporting)
IF[#17>0]

(average Diameter calculation)
(@999 and @998 are set in the web macros)
#131 = [@998 + @999]/2
